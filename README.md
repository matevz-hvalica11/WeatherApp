# 🌦️ Weather App — Modern, Dynamic, Cloud-Deployed

A fully featured, real-time weather application built with ASP.NET Core MVC, WeatherAPI, and Leaflet.js, developed in Visual Studio 2026 and deployed on Microsoft Azure App Service.

This project began as an internship assignment at Business Solutions, but quickly evolved into a complete, production-capable weather platform — designed, expanded, and engineered with real-world software development principles.

## 🚀 Project Vision

What started as a simple “display the temperature” task transformed into a full weather system with forecasting, interactivity, UI theming, geolocation, historical weather lookup, and cloud deployment.

This app demonstrates:

API integration

Frontend + backend synergy

Modern UI/UX design

Real deployment pipelines

Software engineering
