## 🌦️ Weather App

A dynamic, modern weather application built with WeatherAPI, developed in Visual Studio, and deployed to the Cloud.

## 🚀 Project Origin

This project started as a small internship task at Business Solutions and evolved into a personal project focused on building a feature-rich, real-world web application.

Instead of stopping at a basic weather display, the scope was expanded to include live data, interactive features, and full cloud deployment.


## ✨ Features

3-day forecast and 24-hour hourly overview,

UV index, Wind Speed, Humidity, Precipitation, Dew Point, and Air Quality,

Manual refresh and automatic refresh every 5 minutes,

Light / Dark Theme toggle and °C / °F unit switching,

Weather-based background changes and a real-time clock,

One-click weather sharing via the browser,

Integrated with leaflet.js, allowing users to explore weather data by location,

Automatic geolocation on first visit (with user permission) to display weather based on the user’s exact position.


## ☁️ Cloud Deployment

The application is hosted on Azure Cloud, making it globally accessible and suitable for production use.
