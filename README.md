# 🌦️ Weather App — Modern, Dynamic, Cloud-Deployed

A fully featured, real-time weather application built with ASP.NET Core MVC, WeatherAPI, and Leaflet.js, developed in Visual Studio 2026 and deployed on Microsoft Azure App Service.

This project began as an internship assignment at Business Solutions, but quickly evolved into a complete, production-capable weather platform — designed, expanded, and engineered with real-world software development principles.

✔ Modern UI/UX design

✔ Real deployment pipelines

✔ Software engineering
